There are many ways to remove duplicates from randomIntegers. One method is using the Collection API ( HashSet or LinkedHashSet )
and another one is without using the Collection API.First method is easy and gives better performance than the second method.
It is recommended to use the first method if you need to remove duplicates from an array.
